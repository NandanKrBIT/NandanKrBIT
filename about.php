                <p>Present era is an era of globalization where the world is considered to be flat. The era of globalization has come into existence largely because of the internet boom and internet is considered to be the fastest way of communication. Through internet a person can have its presence at any corer of the world. In fact, the world of internet is different from the real world and thus it is called as a virtual world. People are living in this virtual world through social networking websites and not even people but several companies have also made their presence in the virtual world utilizing the internet boom (Cohen, Manion & Morrison, 2007). Internet is not only used to spread awareness about the products but now it is also explicitly used for shopping. Online shopping is new shopping address for the customers and now they can do everything on internet whatever they do while visiting a normal brick and mortar shop.

                    As e-commerce and online shopping is becoming popular and profitable, many companies are now entering this virtual world for opening their online shopping portal. Almost every business in developed countries provides an option of buying products through internet because this helps in increasing the customer base. Same is the case with the Miou Co. Ltd. which is a national supermarket chain in Australia. This company is aiming to open an online grocery shopping website so that customer can also shop through their website. This is a very important step for the company as opening an online shopping portal is a very expensive and complex process unlike a normal street-shop (Creswell, 2002). Internet shops make life of customers more comfortable but at the same time cost associated with opening of internet shops are also high. Thus proper analysis needs to be carried in order to reach a conclusion of opening online shopping website.
